Here's what I'll be using to build this app:

Frontend: React (A frontend JavaScript framework for building interactive applications)
Backend: Node and Express (Express is very popular NodeJS framework that allows us to easily create APIs and backends)
Database: HarperDB (a data + application platform that allows us to query data using either SQL or NoSQL. HarperDB also has a built-in API, saving us from having to write a lot of backend code)
Realtime communication: Socket.io..
